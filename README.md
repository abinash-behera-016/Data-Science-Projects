# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio on GitHub! This repository contains a variety of projects where I apply machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. Each project folder includes relevant datasets in CSV format, R or Python scripts detailing the analysis, and a README explaining the project's context and findings.

## Technologies Used
- R, Python
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Neural Networks
- Packages for modelling: tree, rpart, randomForest, xgboost, nnet, neuralnet, scikit-learn, keras, tensoflow
- Packages for visualization: ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn

Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have questions or would like to collaborate!
